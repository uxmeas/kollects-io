# Real Data Integration Options

## Current Implementation
- ✅ Real wallet data from Flow blockchain
- ✅ Real moment IDs and serial numbers
- ❌ Mock purchase prices (generated)
- ❌ Mock market prices (generated)
- ❌ Mock player/play data (placeholder)

## To Get Real Data:

### 1. Purchase Prices
Purchase price data is NOT stored on the blockchain. Options:
- **Manual Entry**: Users input their purchase prices
- **Transaction History**: Query Flow blockchain events for purchase transactions
- **CSV Import**: Allow users to import their purchase history
- **NFL All Day API**: If they provide transaction history API

### 2. Current Market Prices (Low Ask)
- **NFL All Day Marketplace API**: Query their API for current listings
- **Flow Event Monitoring**: Monitor marketplace listing events
- **Web Scraping**: Scrape marketplace data (not recommended)

### 3. Moment Metadata (Players, Teams, etc.)
- **On-chain Metadata**: Some data might be in the NFT metadata
- **NFL All Day API**: Official API for play/player data
- **IPFS Metadata**: NFT metadata might be stored on IPFS

## Implementation Priority:
1. First: Add manual purchase price entry
2. Second: Integrate with NFL All Day marketplace API for current prices
3. Third: Add transaction history scanning for automatic purchase price detection
4. Fourth: Full metadata integration

## Code Changes Needed:
1. Add database/storage for user-entered purchase prices
2. Create API integration for marketplace data
3. Add transaction scanning functionality
4. Update UI to allow price entry/editing
